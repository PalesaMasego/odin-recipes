<h3> Sun dried tomato chicken pasta dish preps</h3>
<p>This sun-dried tomato chicken pasta dish is my favorite summer meal to serve to guests. It goes great with bruschetta and a glass of wine.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced.</li>
    <li>1 (12 ounce) jar roasted red peppers, drained and chopped</li>
    <li>1 (9 ounce) jar sun-dried tomato pesto.</li>
    <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>1 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 pound dry penne pasta</li>
</ul>


<h3>How to Make Sun-Dried tomato chicken pasta Step-By-Step</h3>
<ol>
    <li> Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add chicken breast; cook and stir until browned, about 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant. Add roasted peppers, sun-dried tomato pesto, cream, basil, and cayenne pepper; stir until well mixed. Simmer over low heat until chicken is cooked through and sauce has thickened, about 20 to 30 minutes</li>
    <li>While sauce is simmering, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in penne and return to a boil; cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain well. </li>
    <li>Spoon sauce over cooked penne.</li>
